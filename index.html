            <p class="hero__description">Rather than websites being able to automatically collect, sort through, and sell your data, the process would instead be opt in. 
                This would vastly change the way websites have to procure profit, as sites like youtube rely on data collection in order to stay up, rather than actually staying profitable.
                Companies would be forced to choose between collecting revenue through another venue, ie increased advertisment, donations, or even asking for a fee, or alternatively having
                to increase the quality of what they offer to the user until people willingly choose to contribute. While many larger websites will suffer and potentially face lowered profit margins for it.
                This right would make it explitly clear if a website should exist in the first place. With people being able to decide if a website has provided high enough quality content to justify them
                contributing towards the websites continued existance. In the physical world large corporations put their smaller local counterparts out of business. They are defended by phrases such as "adapt or die"
                and "sink or swim". This in spite of the fact that many of them are heavily subsidized, or have been saved from the brink of bankruptcy. So under this right we could see if the same holds true online.

                <p class="hero__description">Roughly 27% of Americans online use ad block with a grand total of 46.2% of users worldwide using ad blockers. 41% percent of people use a VPN once a week,
                    and 36% use one every day. While these are wonderful statistics to stare at, its a bit harder to actually make them mean anything. What does usage of ad blockers actually entail? 
                    while I personally have ad block installed and use it when going to new websites. I specifically disable it when I'm on a website that I want to support. Specific Youtube channels, wikipedia,
                    and various smaller websites. Usage of ad blockers does not mean people are unwilling to support online entities, and a similar thing can be said for VPNs. 
                    Only a tiny .66% of the population use the search engine DuckDuckGo which is explitly designed to block data collection at all times. With a rise in the general populations understanding of
                    the risk of being online one would think the difference in people using partially obfuscating services such as ad block and full blockage services such as DuckDuckGo would not be that great, yet 
                    people still choose to view ads, and on initial setup of Windows, allow Microsoft to collect data to "improve their user experience".

            <p class="hero__description">Instead of setting out to establish a hard written out set of rules and regulations that may end up restricting users in unforseen ways the right to choose to contribute
                has the intent to continue allowing online culture to develop naturally over time with a focus on the masses. Over the years there have been websites that have been necessary or at very least felt 
                as such over the years. You couldn't really choose to not use them, but at the same time complying meant that you were adding to their profits and showing that what they were doing works regardless
                of your personal feelings on the service. This meant and still currently means that powerhouse companies can dictate what the internet should look like by filling a quintessential part of online life
                and staying that way by boxing out smaller start ups trying to fit into the same spot. By having to opt in to show we like how a website is doing things the power is taken out of the hands of the 
                few powerful individuals that decide how people should be regulated online. If a website is exploitive, spreads misinformation, or just isn't appealing, you won't have to support it. When your shopping
                in a grocery store and see a gross looking fruit. You aren't obligated to pay the store, so why are you obligated to do so online?
